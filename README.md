# prior-localization
Project seeking to localize encoding of the task prior in the brain

We aim to utilize GLMs and neural decoders to determine how much information a given neuron
or population of neurons encodes about various task-related variables. In particular we seek
to narrow down where we believe the task prior on target location is encoded during the IBL task.
